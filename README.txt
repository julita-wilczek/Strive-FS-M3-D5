The goal is to create a copy of the Spotify interface.

The required pages are:
- Login page
- Home page
- Artist page
- Album page


Rules for project:
- Organize your styles in order to have reusable classes amongst the whole project / different pages
- Add css either inline or in style.css, not in the head.
- If you are modyfing a boostrap class make sure you only modify a boostrap class for specific section for example instead of writing in css: .bg-light {background-color: pink !important} write #section-name .bg-light {background-color: pink !important} or any other selector that limits the scope of the changes only to selected area.

Key things to coordinate:
- dimensions of the site
- responsiveness (see real Spotify for inspiration)
